# Randomized Optimization
The purpose of this project is to explore random search. I will implement several randomized search algorithms and apply them to problems that exercise the strengths of each.

The four local random search algorithms to be implemented are:
- **randomized hill climbing**
- **simulated annealing**
- **a genetic algorithm**
- **MIMIC**

I will use the first three algorithms to find good weights for a neural network. In particular, I will use them instead of backpropagation for the neural network in the Speech Emotion Recognition problem. The weights in a neural network are continuous and real-valued instead of discrete so how to apply these algorithms in such a domain should be considered.
